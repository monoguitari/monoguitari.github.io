    title: "Integrating Neural Networks with Linear Regression to Enhance Control Vectors in Social Sciences",
    desc: "This project explores the integration of neural network-based feature extraction with traditional linear regression models to improve prediction accuracy in the social sciences. This approach aims to maintain the interpretability of linear models while leveraging the predictive power of neural networks to enhance feature representation. This method could be particularly useful in fields where the interaction effects of variables are significant but difficult to model linearly.",

    title: "Web Chat Application with RESTful API and Websockets",
    desc: "This project involved creating a web chat application inspired by platforms like Discord and Instagram. It features chat room creation, private messaging, and user management using a RESTful API and websockets. The frontend was built with React, while the backend utilized GoLang with the Gin framework for endpoints, gorilla-websocket for live chat, and a custom user authentication system. The project demonstrates the integration of modular frontend components with backend logic to handle real-time messaging and user interactions.",
